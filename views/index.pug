    p.lead
      | We are a team of scientists and engineers and we develop IoT hardware solutions in combination with our wireless, 
      | open source control platform. 
      br
      | Instead of creating big data on centralized computer centers, we employ cost effective
      | state-machines which allow us to dynamically control several aspects of a single problem with a single computer which is
      | adapted to the required performance of each application. 
      | The use of open source software provides full transparency to the user
      | (i.e. source code) and enables us to prototype fast solutions since we can build our applications on top of already existing software.
      br 
      | The control interfaces are platform independent and can be deployed from mobile devices as well as from desktop computers. 
    p.lead
      | Our strong expertise within high power electronics and radio frequency enables us to develop device controllers for different
      | kinds of medical, manufacturing and R&amp;D applications.
